🌍 The Problem We Solve

⚠️ 1.6 billion adults globally remain financially excluded because they lack official identity documents.

This invisible population cannot:

Open bank accounts

Access loans/credit

Participate in the formal economy

Safely send or receive money

Build credit or reputation

💡 CryptoID breaks this cycle by generating decentralized, secure, and verifiable digital identities without requiring traditional paperwork.

✨ Key Features

✅ Encryption (Jlyn Cipher) – Proprietary algorithm designed for behavioral biometrics
✅ Behavioral Biometrics (50+ Patterns) – Keystroke, mouse, touch, device flow
✅ Social Proof – Community vouching & cryptographic reputation scoring
✅ Adaptive Risk Assessment – Real-time fraud detection & anomaly tracking
✅ Blockchain Certificates – Immutable, decentralized identity proofs
✅ WebRTC P2P Verification – Works offline in remote areas
✅ PWA Offline-First – Cross-platform, installable, fully offline support
