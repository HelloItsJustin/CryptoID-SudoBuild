🌟 CryptoID — Invisible Identity for the Unbanked
🚀 Revolutionary Identity Verification for 1.6 Billion People

CryptoID is a next-generation Progressive Web Application that uses advanced behavioral biometrics and proprietary encryption to create verifiable digital identities for the world’s financially excluded population.

Developed for the SUDO // BUILD Hackathon 2025, CryptoID directly tackles the identity gap preventing 1.6 billion people from accessing essential financial services.

🌍 The Problem

1.6 billion adults globally remain financially excluded due to lack of formal identification.

This “invisible billion” faces systemic barriers:

❌ Cannot open bank accounts

❌ No access to credit or loans

❌ Excluded from formal economy

❌ Unsafe remittances

❌ No credit history or financial reputation

CryptoID breaks this cycle by enabling cryptographically secure digital identities without relying on traditional documents.
