🌟 CryptoID - Invisible Identity for the Unbanked

CryptoID is a groundbreaking Progressive Web Application that leverages advanced behavioral biometrics and proprietary encryption to create verifiable digital identities for the world's financially excluded population. Built for the SUDO // BUILD Hackathon 2025, this platform addresses the critical identity bottleneck preventing 1.6 billion people from accessing basic financial services.

🌍 The Problem We Solve
1.6 billion adults globally remain financially excluded due to the lack of official identity documentation. This "invisible billion" cannot:

Open bank accounts

Access credit or loans

Participate in the formal economy

Send or receive remittances safely

Build credit history or financial reputation

CryptoID breaks this cycle by creating cryptographically secure digital identities without requiring traditional documentation.
